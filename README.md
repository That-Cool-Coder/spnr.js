# spnr.js

(short for spanner)

## A multipurpose, flexible, and fast JavaScript library for the frontend

Up to and including version 1.4, this library was known as wrk.js, but had to be renamed due to a naming conflict. Apart from the name change, version 1.5 of spnr.js is near-identical to wrk.js v1.4.

#### Goals:
- Be fast through simplicity
- Leave no unexpected suprises
- Fill in the holes of p5.js (such as functions not prefixed with p5 and vectors containing the whole p5 instance)
- Have a good name
