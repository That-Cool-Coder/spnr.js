spnr.Neuron
spnr.Neuron(bias=spnr.randflt(-1, 1))
var neuron = new spnr.Neuron(0.2)
A generic neuron class. Designed to primarily be used by spnr.neuralNetwork. ```bias``` shouldn't ever need to be set.

spnr.Neuron.connect()
spnr.Neuron.connect(neuron, weight=spnr.randflt(0, 1))
neuron.connect(neuron2, 0.3325)
Form a connection between neuron being called (```neuron``` in the example) and the neuron being passed in (```neuron2``` in the example) such that neuron being called outputs to the neuron being passed.

spnr.Neuron.activate()
spnr.Neuron.activate(input)
var result = neuron.activate(input)
Activate the neuron. Not recommended to call this directly. In short, read ```input```, find which neuron it was sent from, use the weight to change the value and then save the output before returning it.

spnr.Neuron.propagate()
spnr.Neuron.propagate(target, rate=0.3)
neuron.propagate(0.5, 0.5)
Propagate the wrongness. Not recommended to call this directly. In short, read ```target```, find what you did wrong and change the weights, then make the other neurons change some weights. It's really confusing.
